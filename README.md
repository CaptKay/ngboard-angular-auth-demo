# NgBoard – Angular 20 Auth + Roles Demo

NgBoard is a small but realistic dashboard built with **Angular 20**, focusing on:

- Modern Angular patterns (standalone components, `input()` / `output()`, signals)
- Firebase **email/password authentication**
- **Role-based access control** (user vs admin) with guards
- Protected routes and clean layout for a real-world style dashboard

This repo is part of my ongoing Full-Stack TypeScript / Angular learning journey.
